<p>All about Dale Ann. I enjoy hiking, biking and camping in the summer. I love to travel to warmer destinations in winter, but if I must be cold, I love the quietness and solitude of cross country skiing. Throughout all the seasons, I love spending time with my family, walking my dogs, photography, volunteer work, and reading. I'm a non-traditional (a.k.a. OLDER) student enjoying the challenges and connections that Salt Lake Community College is giving me.</p>
